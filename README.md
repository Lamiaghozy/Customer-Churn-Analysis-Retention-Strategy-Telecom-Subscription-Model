# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Retention-Strategy-Telecom-Subscription-Model
This project evaluates customer churn within a subscription-based telecom model to diagnose revenue leakage and identify retention levers. Rather than reporting churn rates, the analysis isolates structural churn concentration across contract types, demographic segments, and usage behaviors.
