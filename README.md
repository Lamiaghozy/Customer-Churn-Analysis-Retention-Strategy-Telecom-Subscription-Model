# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Retention-Strategy-Telecom-Subscription-Model

Executive Summary

This project evaluates customer churn within a subscription-based telecom model to diagnose revenue leakage and identify retention levers. Rather than reporting churn rates, the analysis isolates structural churn concentration across contract types, demographic segments, and usage behaviours.
By segmenting churn risk and modelling retention impact, the project highlights how targeted interventions can materially improve customer lifetime value (LTV) and recurring revenue stability.
Churn reduction is framed as a revenue protection strategy rather than a reporting metric.

Financial & Strategic Framing

This project quantifies:
•	Revenue exposure by high-risk segments
•	Contract-structure vulnerability
•	Behavioural churn indicators
•	Plan pricing sensitivity
•	Retention opportunity concentration

Key commercial insight:
Churn is not evenly distributed; it is structurally concentrated. Targeted retention strategies outperform broad-based acquisition spending in ROI efficiency.
This project demonstrates the application of revenue retention analytics within subscription-based business models.
Overview
This project analyses customer churn for a subscription-based telecom company (Databel). The objective was not only to calculate churn rates, but to diagnose the structural drivers of attrition and design data-driven retention strategies.
Using Excel-based modelling and dashboarding techniques, the analysis translates churn metrics into actionable commercial insights for revenue protection and lifetime value optimisation.

🧠 Analytical Approach
The analysis followed a structured 3-phase methodology:
Phase 1: Diagnostic Exploration
•	Data cleaning & preparation
•	Calculated churn indicators
•	Exploratory PivotTable analysis
•	Root-cause investigation of churn reasons

Phase 2: Segment-Level Pattern Analysis
•	Demographic churn breakdown (age groups, senior citizens)
•	Contract-type analysis (monthly vs long-term contracts)
•	Plan-type assessment (unlimited vs capped plans)
•	International usage impact on churn
•	Behavioural segmentation

Phase 3: Executive Dashboard & Storytelling
•	KPI consolidation
•	Churn rate by segment visualisation
•	Demographic & consumption overlays
•	Strategic insight synthesis

📈 Key Insights (Simulated Findings)

The structured analysis revealed:
•	Higher churn concentration in short-term contract customers
•	Increased attrition among specific age brackets
•	Behavioural risk signals tied to international call usage
•	Unlimited plan pricing sensitivity effects
•	Elevated churn among senior customer segments
These findings highlighted both structural and behavioural drivers of revenue leakage.
